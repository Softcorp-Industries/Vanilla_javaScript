          In computer science, a data structure is a data organization,
          management, and storage format that enables efficient access and
          modification.More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
          values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations
          that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure
          about data.

          Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types (ADT). The
          ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure
          implements the physical form of the data type. Different types of data
          structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are
          highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, relational
          databases commonly use B-tree indexes for data retrieval, while
          compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up
          identifiers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data
          efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing
          services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing
          efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming
          languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the
          key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used
          to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both
          main memory and secondary memory.

      <p class="subHeader">What is a Data Structure?</p>
      <p>
        Data structures are generally based on the ability of a computer to
        fetch and store data at any place in its memory, specified by a
        pointerâ€”a bit string, representing a memory address, that can be itself
        stored in memory and manipulated by the program. Thus, the array and
        record data structures are based on computing the addresses of data
        items with arithmetic operations, while the linked data structures are
        based on storing addresses of data items within the structure itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The implementation of a data structure usually requires writing a set of
        procedures that create and manipulate instances of that structure. The
        efficiency of a data structure cannot be analyzed separately from those
        operations. This observation motivates the theoretical concept of an
        abstract data type, a data structure that is defined indirectly by the
        operations that may be performed on it, and the mathematical properties
        of those operations (including their space and time cost).
